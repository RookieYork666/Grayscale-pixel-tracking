# Grayscale-pixel-tracking
The attachment codes for MPE thesis, which is inspired by the Lagrange perspective. 

The file named weith ReduceResolution is used to modify the resolution of random video, can transfer to another format as well.

Greytest m file contains the algorothm to tracking the grayscale of pixels and apply the fast fourier transform to extract the pulse rate.

To get idea result, the input video is suggested to be processed through EVM(Eulerian Video Magenification), check the thesis for further detail.
